## About

This library primarily contains some Thymeleaf template fragments that are commonly used to render the UI
of internal pages of Edison Microservices.

You can replace fragments of these pages by copying + modifying these fragments. For example, you can add
menu items to the main menu by overriding templates/fragments/navbar/main.html.
