# Edison Mongo

MongoDB persistence for Edison Microservices.

## Configuration
 
 TODO
 
## MongoJobRepository

If edison-mongo is configured appropriately and edison-jobs is in the classpath, a MongoDB implementation
of the JobRepository is automatically configured.

This provides persistence for Jobs, so job information can be gathered in clustered environments.
